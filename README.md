# zhundao
Just a very very lowbie crack to grab MYS library volunteer tickets


	for instance, 'http://m.zhundao.net/NoUserIno/ActivityDetail/10843' is a register url. By observing the url, we are easy find the data is dicide to the number after last slash(\).
	So what we need to do, is changing the userid where in the "Cookie" of headers as well as the activityid, username, mobile... which is marked by "#" in data.
	last, we just wait for the time when it began to grab, and run the zhundao1.py
	Optionaly, if you want cancel the register, however,the website is something laji such that you can't open it. This time you can change the userid of zhundao2.py, and then running it is ok.

Environment required: 
	First, python3.x environment;
	Second, requsts, re, time module needed;

Last words:
	Life is short, you need python!
